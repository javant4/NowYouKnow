# Now You Know

## What is the app?
 * The invention is a mobile app functions to allow students that have a specialized trade or skill in photography/videography, doing/cutting hair, styling/clothes
alterations, fixing computers/phones, car
maintenance, etc. to connect with UC
students that have these needs. The goal of
this app is to not only highlight the multitalented
UC community but add as an extra
medium for connecting students in this
digital gig-economy.

## What problem is being solved?
* As engaging members of the UC
community we have been able to
identify many students are unfamiliar with
the city to know where to get these
services done, some have a low
comfortable level to venture outside of
the UC/Clifton area, as well as
limited access to transportation to reach
the target service areas. The app will allow
students to utilize and access these
services right at their front door. Our
target customers are college communities
as they can benefit greatly from this
resource.
## What would you like to do with your invention? 
* We would like to service to be able to
reach and connect as many people
as possible starting with the UC
community and eventually expanding .
Every need across the world is different but
this app will connect people who can fill 
that need. We would like this app to be
apart of people's everyday life and
transform their skills into
entrepreneurial endeavors.

## Why do you think this is a great idea? 
* This app is a great idea because it will allow
students to confidently navigate unfamiliar
spaces knowing the everyday services found at
home are only a few clicks away. In the app,
students will have the option to register as a
seller and build a profile displaying their work or
as a customer. Customers will be able to book a
service and chat with the seller about quotes and
pricing.
